# Hello. I am sil.je!

That's Silje Enge Kristensen to you! My day job is herding wayward containers, and turning things off and on again. I help organize [Oslo Mechanical Keyboard Club](https://www.meetup.com/Oslo-Mechanical-Keyboard-Club/), [Oslo NixOS Usergroup](https://www.meetup.com/Oslo-NixOS-User-Group/) and [Hackeriet](https://www.meetup.com/hackeriet/). My pronouns are she/her. 

I like books, mechanical keyboards, movies and girevoy sport.
